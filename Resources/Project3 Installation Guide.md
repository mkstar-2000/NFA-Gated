# NFA - NotFinancialAdvice
# NFA Installation Guide


NFA is a Python Financial Analysis package that provides a single platform to access multiple ways analyze the financial markets.

Follow the steps below to install and set up NFA in your Python environment. 


**NOTE:** Make sure that you are using your conda environment that has anaconda installed. Create a new environment for this, using:

```shell
conda update anaconda
conda create -n NFA python=3.7 anaconda -y
conda activate NFA
```

Before installing the NFA dependencies, you need to install a couple of libraries. First, install the `nb_conda` package that will allow you to switch between virtual environments in Jupyter lab.

```shell
conda install -c anaconda nb_conda -y
```

Follow the next steps to install NFA and all its dependencies in your Python virtual environment.

1. Download the NFA library **Prophet**. 

*from prophet import Prophet*

Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well

Example usage:

      from prophet import Prophet
      
      m = Prophet()
      
      m.fit(df)  # df is a pandas.DataFrame with 'y' and 'ds' columns
      
      future = m.make_future_dataframe(periods=365)
      
      m.predict(future)


```shell
pip install prophet
```

## Troubleshooting

If you experience blank plots rendering in your Jupyter Lab preview, try the following steps:

1. First, clear your browser cache.

    - If using Chrome, you can do this by right clicking and choosing `Inspect` from the drop menu.
    
    ![clear_browser_cache1](../Images/clear_browser_cache1.PNG)

    - Next, hold down click on the browser reload button which will cause another drop down menu to appear.  From this menu select `Empty Cache and Hard Reload`.

      ![clear_browser_cache2](../Images/clear_browser_cache2.PNG)

3. Then clear the Kernel cache:

    - Click the `Kernel` drop down menu inside Jupyter Lab.  From this menu, click `Restart Kernel and Clear Outputs`.

      ![clear_kernel_cache](../Images/clear_kernel_cache.PNG)

4. After these steps are completed, re-run your notebook. 

5. If your browser is Chrome, and you continue to render blank plots after completing the previous 4 steps, try updating Chrome. Instructions for this can be found [here](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95414?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en).

If you have issues with NFA or Jupyter Lab, you may need to update your Conda environment. Follow the steps below to update the environment and then go back to the install guide to complete a fresh installation of NFA.

1. Deactivate your current Conda environment. This is required in order to update the global Conda environment. Be sure to quit any running applications such as Jupyter prior to deactivating the environment.

    ```shell
    conda deactivate
    ```

2. Update Conda.

    ```shell
    conda update conda
    ```

3. Create a fresh Conda environment to use with NFA.

    ```shell
    conda create -n NFA python=3.7 anaconda
    ```

4. Activate the new environment.

    ```shell
    conda activate NFA
    ```

5. Install the NFA dependencies following the guide above.
